# Mura ORM

* These files are accessible via the browser at `http://localhost:8008/training/3-core/4-mura-beans-and-objects/mura-orm/`.
* As you try each of the `mura-orm` exercises, copy the `/beans` directory from each exercise under either the `model` directory, or your Site or Theme's `/model` directory. *You'll be replacing the `beans` directory on each exercise!*
* Then, you'll need to reload Mura and `applydbupdates`: `http://localhost:8008/training/mura-orm/?appreload&applydbupdates`. This will register the bean(s) and create any necessary tables.
* The `index.cfm` file located under each exercise can be navigated to directly to see the output generated.
